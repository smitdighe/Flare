"""Labeled ground-truth loader — the numbers are only as good as this file.

Reads CICIDS2017 rows (which carry a ``Label`` column) and turns each into a
``NormalizedAlert`` plus the TWO expected outputs the pipeline is scored on.

WHY STRATIFIED SAMPLING
-----------------------
CICIDS2017 is ~80% BENIGN. A uniform random draw of 200 rows yields ~160 benign
flows, a handful of port scans, and quite possibly ZERO of some attack class —
per-class recall for that class is then either undefined or computed on one or
two examples, which is noise dressed up as a metric. :func:`load` therefore
allocates the sample per label: one guaranteed slot per class, then the rest
proportional to class frequency. The draw is seeded (``settings.eval_seed``), so
two runs score the identical sample set.

TWO SEPARATE MAPPINGS
---------------------
:data:`LABEL_TO_ATTACK_TYPE` and :data:`LABEL_TO_SEVERITY` are independent on
purpose. Attack type is *what happened*; severity is *how much it matters*. They
are different targets, scored separately, and conflating them would hide the
case where the system names the attack correctly but triages it at the wrong
urgency (or vice versa).

Rows whose label has no entry in BOTH mappings are excluded from the population
with a loud warning: there is no defensible expected value to score them against.

THE SILENT-FALLBACK BUG THIS MODULE NOW REFUSES TO REPEAT
---------------------------------------------------------
``data/labels/`` was empty for a long stretch. :func:`_candidate_files`
quietly fell back to the 6-row replay placeholder, and every eval then produced
a plausible-looking macro-F1 computed on SIX rows. Nothing failed; the number was
simply meaningless. Two guards close that hole:

* :func:`check_label_health` — called at startup and by ``scripts/run_eval.py``
  before a run — reports the population size, whether the fallback was taken, and
  whether the count clears ``settings.eval_min_label_rows``.
* :func:`load_population` logs at ERROR (not debug, not info) when the loaded
  count is below that threshold, and the eval runner turns it into a ``warn``
  system notice that reaches the dashboard.

A tiny label set is still allowed to run — refusing outright would break a
deliberately small test fixture — but it can no longer happen quietly.
