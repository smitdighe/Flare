"""Offline mode — the whole pipeline, deterministically, with no network.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
Venue wifi dies. Free-tier quota runs out mid-demo. A provider has an outage
twenty minutes before the judging slot. ``OFFLINE_MODE=true`` keeps the demo
running through all three.

WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS SUBSTITUTED — the important part
--------------------------------------------------------
Substituted: ONLY the four leaves that touch the network.

    LLM fast tier      -> OfflineProvider (deterministic)
    LLM quality tier   -> OfflineProvider (deterministic)
    threat intel       -> OfflineIntelSource (deterministic reputation)
    ATT&CK retrieval   -> OfflineRetriever (the committed corpus, no embeddings)

Real, unchanged: the LangGraph graph, every node, both routers, the trace
decorator, the IOC escalation rule, the hallucination guard, the worker pools,
both queues, the event bus, SQLite, the repositories, SSE, and every API route.

This is deliberately NOT a mock that short-circuits the pipeline. The offline
provider returns a genuine :class:`CompletionResult` whose ``text`` is JSON, and
that JSON is parsed by the SAME ``extract_json_meta`` / ``coerce_to_model`` path
a Groq or Gemini response goes through — so a schema change that would break the
live pipeline breaks offline mode too, instead of passing and hiding the break.
The graph literally cannot tell the difference: it resolves providers through
``ProviderRegistry`` exactly as it always does.

HONESTY
-------
Offline responses are heuristics, not a model. Anything derived from them is
labelled as such rather than passed off as a measurement:

* the provider reports ``name="offline"`` and ``model="offline-deterministic"``,
  so a benchmark run in offline mode prints that in its results table;
* :func:`describe` gives the banner the startup logs and ``/health/deep`` show;
* the eval runner emits a warning notice when it scores offline predictions.

Latency is simulated (a few ms, jittered from a seeded RNG) so the dashboard's
duration column is not a row of zeroes — but it is derived from a fixed seed, so
two offline runs produce identical numbers.
