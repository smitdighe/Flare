"""recommend node — quality-tier remediation playbook with a hallucination guard.

The model returns a strict ``Remediation`` object. Two post-validations are
mandatory before we trust it:

* Drop every technique the model cites that was NOT retrieved into
  ``state["techniques"]``. Models reliably emit plausible-looking but fabricated
  T-numbers; a fake technique ID on the judges' screen is indefensible. The kept
  techniques are re-hydrated from OUR retrieved objects (authoritative name/url),
  never from the model's copy.
* Renumber the surviving steps sequentially so ``order`` is always 1..N with no
  gaps, regardless of what the model emitted.
