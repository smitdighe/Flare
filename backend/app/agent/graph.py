"""The compiled triage graph and its wall-clock-bounded runner.

Isolation contract (load-bearing): this module imports NO db, NO event bus, NO
queue, and NO FastAPI. It takes a ``NormalizedAlert`` and returns a
``TriageState``. That is what lets the workers wrap it and the eval harness
replay traffic through the identical code path without a rewrite.

The graph is compiled once (``build_graph`` memoizes) and reused for every alert.
There is deliberately no checkpointer — triage is stateless per alert — but the
node/edge structure is checkpointer-ready, so one can be added later without
touching a single node.
